## Purpose

Evaluate prerequisite bic and symptom bic fixed together and whether SZZ identifies the expected bug-introducing commit set.

## Expected history

```text
c0: create token verifier
c1: weaken token trust predicate
c2: weaken access control condition
c3: fix access control vulnerability
```

## Why this needs `scenario.graph.yml`

This history requires graph-aware scenario semantics that are difficult to express with the normal `scenario.yml` schema.

## Required graph-schema features

- Factors: multiple_bic, causal_chain, single_bfc
- Operation types: replace, write_file
- Expected SZZ policy is defined in `expected_szz`.

## Expected BICs

```text
c1, c2
```

## Evaluation points

- Whether SZZ identifies the expected BIC set.
- Whether structural or contextual history is handled according to the scenario factors.
- Whether the expected_szz evaluation policy is applied correctly.
